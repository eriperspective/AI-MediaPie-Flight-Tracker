## 🎬 Recording Tips

### Camera/Gesture Setup:

2. Hover over header to show icon effects
3. Show international destinations in dropdowns
4. Demonstrate map (colors, route, glow)
5. Show button hovers (ALL turn green!)
6. Show sort dropdown (appears in front!)
7. **BIG FINISH**: Gesture control demo!
   - Make a fist → flights scroll down
