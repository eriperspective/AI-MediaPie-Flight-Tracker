# 🛫 Real Flight API Integration Guide

Your flight booking dashboard can now use **REAL flight data** from two APIs!

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Current Setup (Recommended)
The app currently uses **mock data** by default. It works perfectly and generates realistic flights!

### Option 2: Enable Real API Data

To enable real flight data, you have two options:

---

## 📡 API Option 1: OpenSky Network (FREE, NO KEY REQUIRED!)

**Best for:** Quick setup, no registration needed

### Setup Steps:

1. Open `index.html`
2. Find this line:
   ```html
   <script src="app.js"></script>
   ```
3. Change it to:
   ```html
   <script src="app-with-api.js"></script>
   ```
4. That's it! OpenSky will be used automatically

### How It Works:
- ✅ **Totally free** - no API key needed
- ✅ Fetches **real aircraft callsigns** from live flights
- ✅ Uses real data to generate realistic flight schedules
- ✅ **5-minute caching** to respect rate limits
- ⚠️ Limited to current airborne flights (not scheduled flights)

### What You'll See:
- Real flight callsigns like "UAL1234", "DAL456"
- "LIVE" badge on flight cards
- "Live Data" indicator in results count

---

## 📡 API Option 2: AviationStack (FREE TIER AVAILABLE)

**Best for:** Most accurate scheduled flight data

### Setup Steps:

1. **Get API Key** (2 minutes):
   - Go to https://aviationstack.com/
   - Click "GET FREE API KEY"
   - Sign up with email
   - Copy your API key

2. **Add Key to Code**:
   - Open `app-with-api.js`
   - Find line 15:
     ```javascript
     aviationStackKey: '', // Get free key from https://aviationstack.com/
     ```
   - Add your key:
     ```javascript
     aviationStackKey: 'your_key_here',
     ```

3. **Enable API Version**:
   - Open `index.html`
   - Change script to:
     ```html
     <script src="app-with-api.js"></script>
     ```

### Free Tier Limits:
- ✅ 100 requests/month
- ✅ Real scheduled flight data
- ✅ Actual airlines, times, and routes
- ✅ Perfect for demos and testing

### What You'll See:
- Real airline names
- Actual scheduled departure/arrival times
- Real flight numbers
- "LIVE" badge and "AviationStack" source

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

In `app-with-api.js`, you can customize:

```javascript
const CONFIG = {
    // Toggle real API data on/off
    useRealFlightData: true,  // Set to false for mock data
    
    // Add your AviationStack key
    aviationStackKey: 'your_key_here',
    
    // CORS proxy (needed for browser requests)
    corsProxy: 'https://corsproxy.io/?',
};
```

## 🎯 How the API Priority Works

The app tries APIs in this order:

1. **Check Cache** (5 min) - Instant!
2. **OpenSky Network** - Try first (free, no key)
3. **AviationStack** - Try second (if key configured)
4. **Mock Data** - Fallback if all fail

This ensures your app **always works**, even if APIs are down!

## 🆚 Comparison

| Feature | Mock Data | OpenSky Network | AviationStack |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Cost | Free | Free | Free tier (100/mo) |
| Setup Time | None | 0 min | 2 min |
| API Key | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Required |
| Data Type | Generated | Real aircraft | Real schedules |
| Accuracy | Realistic | Live flights | Scheduled flights |
| Reliability | 100% | ~80% | ~95% |

## 🎬 What Shows "LIVE" Data

When using real APIs, you'll see:

### Flight Cards Show:
```
United • LIVE
--------------
Flight UAL1234 (real callsign!)
JFK → LAX
09:30 → 11:45
$450 per person
```

### Results Header Shows:
```
10 Flights Available • Live Data
```

### Console Logs Show:
```
🔍 Fetching real flight data...
✅ Got flights from OpenSky Network
```

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "No flight data available"
- **Solution**: The app automatically falls back to mock data
- APIs may be rate-limited or temporarily down
- Mock data looks identical and works perfectly!

### CORS Errors
- We use `corsproxy.io` to bypass browser restrictions
- If it's down, try changing to: `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/`

### AviationStack "Invalid Key"
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Make sure no extra spaces
- Verify key is activated on their dashboard

1. Change `index.html` to use `app-with-api.js`
2. Optionally add AviationStack key
3. Reload page
4. Search for flights!

## ❓ Questions?

Check the console logs - they tell you exactly what's happening:
- Which API is being tried
